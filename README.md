## Boswell
Boswell is a Maplestory emulator project that slowly is rewriting OdinMS 
into something more modern using Kotlin! With Kotlin's 100% interoperability with Java, 
you can hypothetically rewrite the source while keeping it online and playable. 
Since much more is now known about the inner-mechanics of the game, I'll be trying 
to use more of the Nexon-like naming conventions in this project.

Boswell is based on a former project of mine using the same name. That project 
can be found [here](https://github.com/boswell83/boswell).
